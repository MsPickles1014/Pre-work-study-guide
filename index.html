          Inside the tag is the an attribute that defines additional info about the element.</li>
         </li>
<p><ul>***html elements are case senative***</ul>

<ul>
<li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
<li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
<li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), -a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li> 
<li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</ul> 

  <h4>***Three Ways To Style A Webpage Using CSS***</h4>
 
  <ul>         
  <li>Inline CSS-used to style an element directly in the HTML file</li> 
  <li>Internal CSS style sheet -entire stylesheet embedded directly in the HTML
  a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li> 
  <li>External CSS style sheet -is preferred in most cases because it allows developers 
  to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li> 
  <li>Selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.
  <li>{Declaration} contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
   <li>	The {margin} property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
<li>The {padding}property adds space around the content inside an element.
**Increasing the padding, makes the entire element bigger!** 
  </li>
  <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins 
    outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. </li>
<li>{* selector}- applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.
  ** two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.**
    </li>
<li>{text-align} - is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage. </li>
<li> {img} selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup  </li>
<li>{display} property is assigned with the {block} value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
<li>{link} element creates the connection to the external file.</li>

<li>{rel} attribute specifies the relationship between the current document 
and the linked document resource.</li>
<li>{href} attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. 
**The {href} attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location** </li>
<li>{Class} attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
</ul>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Git: a version control ststem that lets the developer
          manage and keep track of each version of a project
        </li>
        <li>Github: A cloud based hosting service that allows 
          tracking of projects inside repositories stored remotely</li>
          <li> It allows developers to colaborate with other developers</li>
        
        <h4> Basics about Github </h4>
        <li>Allows multiple persons to make changes to project at same time </li>
        <li>Every project is called a repository</li>
        <li>Think of a repository a folder that holds all the files to a 
          specific application </li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        
        
      <h4>Github Workflow</h4>
    <li>Create a branch </li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
  <li> git status: confirms you are on the new branch</li>
<li>git add -A: stages the file by indiacting to git that we want to save
   all the changes to the file</li>
  <li>git commit -m {commit message}</li>
  <li>git pull origin main: pulls source from github to ensure all changes were made</li>
  <ul>***if current branch is up to date, message will read: Already up to date***</ul>
<li>git push origin feature/starter-code: pushes code to individual branch and not main branch  </li>
<ul>***This is essential to keeping bugs from affecting the main project***</ul>
<li>git checkout main: directs user back to the main branch</li>
<li>git pull origin main: pulls down the lastest version of the main branch</li>
<li>git restore {name of file}: restores file to previous state without with out saving changes </li>
</ul>

<h4> Steps To Save Code To Github</h4>
<ul><li>Step 1. Confirm you are on the correct branch from your command line {git status}</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 2. Use the {git add -A} command in your terminal to stage/commit all your files in the working branch to your working directory staging area of git</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 3. Commit files to your repository with the following command:
{git commit -m "added code to HTML file"
use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. It should be short and discriptive.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Step 4. check that your current branch is up to date before opening a pull request.
{git pull origin main}
message should read {Already up to date}</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 5. push up all of our changes to github by using the following command
git push origin feature/add-html</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 6. navigate to your feature branch in the repository on GitHub</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 7. click the "Pull Requests" tab at the top of the page</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 8. On the pull requests page, find and click the "New pull request" button</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 9 Compare the two branches that we want to merge..Arrow should be pointing from Compare{Feature} branch to Base{Main} branch.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 10. Once on the pull request form, give your PR a title and a short description of the changes</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 11. Click the "Create pull request" button.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 12. Click the "Merge pull request" button and confirm that the message reads { This branch has no conflict with the main branch}.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 13. A successful merge should read {Pull request succefully merged and closed}</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 14. Navigate back to the main branch in GitHub, and you should see that your merged file is now there</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 15. Update local repository with the new merged-in feature by opening up terminal and entering commad {git checkout main} then {git pull origin main}</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 16. Go back to Github and close the issue associated with this pull request</li></ul>
