        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Html is used to build a sturdy framework</li>
          <li>Elements can be text, images, header, or list</li>
         <li>Element Types: Meta-Related, Content Division and Semantic</li>
        <p><ul>***Semantic Element describes its content and the role it plays on the page***</ul>
          <ul> ***It also makes html easier to be read by other developers and browsers***</ul></p>
         <li>Each element performs a unique role</li>
          <li>Head Element contains information about the webpage.
            Also, contains information or METADATA that helps the browser render the page correcly </li>
            <li>Body Element: represents the visible content shown to the user.</li><li>BODY element: contains content that the end user will see in the browser</li>
          <li>!Doctype HTML: tells the browser the document type it should expect to open</li>
<li>HTML tag represents the start or root of html document.
          Inside the tag is the an attribute that defines additional info about the element.</li>
         </li>
<p><ul>***html elements are case senative***</ul>
   <ul>***html attributes are always defined in the begining element, never the closing***</li>
  </ul></p>
  <h4>Head of HTML Document</h4>
<p> <li>TITLE: defintions the webpage title (req. element and needed for SEO )</li>
<li>SEO-Search Engine Optimization (needed to improve website rank among searches like google, bing, ect) </li>
<li>STYLE:defines the Css styles associated with the website </li>
<li>BASE: Defines the base URL for webpage</li>
<li>LINK: Connects an external resource to the html document</li>
<li>META: Defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewpoint</li>
<li>SCRIPT: Embeds client-side script in the html document</li>
<li>CHARSET: defines the character set (this attribute is defined by Meta Element)</li> 
<li>/HEAD: Closing tag</li> 
</p>
<p><ul>**All tags begins with open angle brackets and ends with***
</ul></p>
  <li> Elements can be a parent or a child</li>
  <li>Parent elements hold nested elementsknown as child elements </li> 
<li>HEADING ELEMENTS (h1, h2, h3, h4, ect): represents the level of given text box</li>
<h4>Body of HTML Document</h4>
<li>Body elements: contain the content that user see when looking at the
  the webpage in the browser, define the body of the document, and 
is a semantic HTML element</li>
  <li></li>

        <h2>Css</h2>
<ul>
<li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
<li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
<li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), -a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li> 
<li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</ul> 

  <h4>***Three Ways To Style A Webpage Using CSS***</h4>
 
  <ul>         
  <li>Inline CSS-used to style an element directly in the HTML file</li> 
  <li>Internal CSS style sheet -entire stylesheet embedded directly in the HTML
  a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li> 
  <li>External CSS style sheet -is preferred in most cases because it allows developers 
  to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li> 
  <li>Selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.
  <li>{Declaration} contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
   <li>	The {margin} property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
<li>The {padding}property adds space around the content inside an element.
**Increasing the padding, makes the entire element bigger!** 
  </li>
  <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins 
    outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. </li>
<li>{* selector}- applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.
  ** two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.**
    </li>
<li>{text-align} - is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage. </li>
<li> {img} selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup  </li>
<li>{display} property is assigned with the {block} value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
<li>{link} element creates the connection to the external file.</li>

<li>{rel} attribute specifies the relationship between the current document 
and the linked document resource.</li>
<li>{href} attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. 
**The {href} attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location** </li>
<li>{Class} attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
</ul>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Git: a version control ststem that lets the developer
          manage and keep track of each version of a project
        </li>
        <li>Github: A cloud based hosting service that allows 
          tracking of projects inside repositories stored remotely</li>
          <li> It allows developers to colaborate with other developers</li>
        
        <h4> Basics about Github </h4>
        <li>Allows multiple persons to make changes to project at same time </li>
        <li>Every project is called a repository</li>
        <li>Think of a repository a folder that holds all the files to a 
          specific application </li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        
        
      <h4>Github Workflow</h4>
    <li>Create a branch </li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
  <li> git status: confirms you are on the new branch</li>
<li>git add -A: stages the file by indiacting to git that we want to save
   all the changes to the file</li>
  <li>git commit -m {commit message}</li>
  <li>git pull origin main: pulls source from github to ensure all changes were made</li>
  <ul>***if current branch is up to date, message will read: Already up to date***</ul>
<li>git push origin feature/starter-code: pushes code to individual branch and not main branch  </li>
<ul>***This is essential to keeping bugs from affecting the main project***</ul>
<li>git checkout main: directs user back to the main branch</li>
<li>git pull origin main: pulls down the lastest version of the main branch</li>
<li>git restore {name of file}: restores file to previous state without with out saving changes </li>
</ul>

<h4> Steps To Save Code To Github</h4>
<ul><li>Step 1. Confirm you are on the correct branch from your command line {git status}</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 2. Use the {git add -A} command in your terminal to stage/commit all your files in the working branch to your working directory staging area of git</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 3. Commit files to your repository with the following command:
{git commit -m "added code to HTML file"
use the -m flag to associate a message with our commit. It should be short and discriptive.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Step 4. check that your current branch is up to date before opening a pull request.
{git pull origin main}
message should read {Already up to date}</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 5. push up all of our changes to github by using the following command
git push origin feature/add-html</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 6. navigate to your feature branch in the repository on GitHub</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 7. click the "Pull Requests" tab at the top of the page</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 8. On the pull requests page, find and click the "New pull request" button</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 9 Compare the two branches that we want to merge..Arrow should be pointing from Compare{Feature} branch to Base{Main} branch.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 10. Once on the pull request form, give your PR a title and a short description of the changes</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 11. Click the "Create pull request" button.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 12. Click the "Merge pull request" button and confirm that the message reads { This branch has no conflict with the main branch}.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 13. A successful merge should read {Pull request succefully merged and closed}</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 14. Navigate back to the main branch in GitHub, and you should see that your merged file is now there</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 15. Update local repository with the new merged-in feature by opening up terminal and entering commad {git checkout main} then {git pull origin main}</li></ul>
<ul><li>Step 16. Go back to Github and close the issue associated with this pull request</li></ul>

  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <ul>
    <h4>JAVA SCRIPT</h4>
<li> JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
<ul>***allows user to click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form</ul>
<ul><H4>JavaScript features</H4></ul>
<li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
<li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
variables
<li>String is a sequence of characters used to represent text   </li>                                
<ul>*** All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.***</ul>

<li>data types-primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) - is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. ***All primitives are immutable; that is, they cannot be altered.***
<li> control flow- the order in which a computer executes code in a JavaScript file
<ul><h4> JavaScript Basics </h4><ul>
<li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)- provides functionality such as:
<li> dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles</li>
<li>collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam</li>
<li>generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li> </li>
<li> If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems. Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this dependency</li>
<ul><h4>Variables</h4></ul>
<li> Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable
***{ let myVariable;}*** A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement.</li>
<li> JavaScript is case sensitive. </li>
<ul><h4>Comments</h4></ul>
<li> Comments can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. </li>
<li>JavaScript comments are written as {/*Everything in between is a comment.*/}</li>
<ul><h4>Operators</h4></ul>
<li> An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables)</li>
<ul><h4>Conditionals</h4></ul>
<li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li> 
***The expression inside the  {    if ()    }  is the test. If this comparison returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of code (—after the else statement—)runs instead.***
<ul><h4>Functions</h4></ul>
<li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code</li>
***something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses— () —it is likely a function. ***
<li>Events-code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response.</li>
<ul> <h4>7 primitive data types</h4></ul>
<li>
1****mutable value is one that can be changed without creating an entirely new value (objects and arrays are mutable by default)
</li>	
<li> 
2****Number is a numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating point format (IEEE 754)
</li>
<li> 3****BigInt is a numeric data type that can represent integers in the arbitrary precision format</li>
<li> 4****Boolean is a logical data type that can have only the values true or false. </li>
<li>5****Undefined is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared, or to formal 
arguments for which there are no actual arguments.</li>
<li>6****Symbol is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol primitive </li>
<li>7****null value represents a reference that points, generally intentionally, to a nonexistent or invalid object or address.</li>
<ul>
<li>immutable value - is one whose content cannot be changed without creating an entirely new value, in comparison with mutable values.</li>
</ul>
   
<h4>Create a new file folder</h4> 
<li>enter touch [folder name. file type (html, css,js)] in the command line.</li>
<h4>Control flow</h4>
<li>Control flow - is the order in which a computer executes code in a script based on our instructions
***In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.***
</li>
<li>Control flow works in a linear, from top to bottom. </li>
<li>Developers can instruct a program to deviate from its norm if certain conditions are met.</li>
<li>if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code
If() statements are used to determine whether a condition is true or false, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true. An 
</li>

<ul><h4>To create an if statement in JavaScript</h4></ul>
***if (condition) {// block of code to be executed if condition is truthy}***

<li>if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then 
the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
<li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>	
<li>All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy</li>
<li>by using else if, we can have more than one condition </li>
<li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control
 the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li> 
<li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true</li>
  <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically
     used to hold data that is related in some way. 
***It evaluates a dozen or even hundreds of values at a time.***</li>
<li>arrays can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on</li>
<li>****const studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true];****</li>
<li>When working with single data items, we simply used the variable name,  to access the stored data

<li>	an index-a unique number used to access individual data inside the array.</li>
<li>first item in any array always has an index of 0,</li>
<li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items 
in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li> 
<li>	conditional if statement is used to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of 
code a specific number of times.</li>
<li>	Length tells the loop how many times the code will run until there are no items left
   in the array.</li>
  <li>	let, followed by a unique variable name and the assignment 
    operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable. However, unlike with const, let allows 
    us to reassign the value of the variable over time.</li> 
    <li>A {for} loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
      <li>1.	The first statement declared a variable x and given a value of 0, determines the starting point of the loop;
         keeps track of how many times the code will execute</li>
        <li>2.	The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the
           array, the loop will keep running.</li>
          <li>3.	The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item</li>
<li>***For(var x = 0 ;	x < shape . length ;   X++ )</li>
<li>***Code Block- { // console log (shapes [x];  } repeats for each item in our array
<li>4.	The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code:
<li>5.	A for loop starts with for
<li>6.	we put the code that we want to be executed for each loop inside curly brackets


<ul><H4>JAVA SCRIPT FUNTIONS</H4></ul>

<li>	Function- is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. (groups a set of instruction)</li>
<li>	Functions are reusable blocks of code that contain instructions to perform a specific task.</li>
<li>Functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, it must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li> 
  <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses.</li> 
    Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform</li>
    <li>There are Multiple ways to define a function:</li>
</li>

<ul><h4>Write a function</h4></ul>

<h5>EXAMPLE Function declaration:                     ***maketea() { 
// code block
}***</h5>
<li>  
function          
Uses function keyword and function name to define function  </li>
<li>Code block is written instruct for what the function should do -AKA- function Body</li>
<li>Steps to execute are written as console logs: 
function maketea() { 
// console.log (“Heating up the water”);
console.log  (“Putting the tea bag into the heated water!”);
console.log  (“Pouring the tea into a cup!”);
}  </li>        
<li>To execute function, it needs to be called
  maketea () ;       </li>              
  <li>Functions in JavaScript are used to define and reuse blocks of code</li>
    <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ().</li>
      <li>The code to be executed is written inside the curly brackets {}.</li>

<h5>Call a function</h5> 
<li>To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute</li>
<li>Add  [function-name () ] at the bottom of the [ your-js- file name .js ] file so that our [function-name () ] function will run</li>
<li>To randomize our selection, we need to use a special Math function that helps us select a random number.</li>
<li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number. </li>
